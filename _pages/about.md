I am a junior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). I am fortunate to work as machine translation intern in [Nature Language Processing Research Group](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/) under the guidance of Prof. [Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/). During my sophomore year, I engaged in two significant projects. The first project involved mouse glomerular semantic segmentation, where I received instruction from Prof. [Wujun Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/index.htm). The second project focused on high-realistic view generation techniques for video calls and was supervised by [Jie Tang](https://tangjie-njucs.github.io/) and [Jie Liu](https://njulj.github.io/). This project achieved recognition by reaching the final round of the Nanjing University-Huawei Cup Future Technology Competition.

Previously, I also had a fantastic experience in the industry. I have worked as an engineering intern with Pixel Tips team in Google, Shanghai.
