I am a junior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). During my sophomore year, I was fortunate to work as a research intern in [Nature Language Processing Research Group](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/) where I got into ML and NLP research under the guidance of [Prof. Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/). Currently, I work as a research intern in [XLANG Lab](https://www.xlang.ai/) with [Prof. Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/). Previously, I also had a fantastic experience in the industry. I have worked as an engineering intern with Pixel Tips team in Google, Shanghai.

My research interests lie in ML and NLP. Nowadays, I'm interested in building Vision-Language Models as agents in the real world.
