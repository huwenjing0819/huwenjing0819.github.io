I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/). I am fortunate to work as machine translation intern in [Nature Language Processing Research Group](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/) under the guidance of Prof. [Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/). In my sophomore year, I had two project experiences. One is a mouse glomerular semantic segmentation, instructed by Prof. [Wujun Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/index.htm). The other is a high-realistic view generation technique in video calls, instructed by [Jie Tang](https://tangjie-njucs.github.io/) and [Jie Liu](https://njulj.github.io/), was shortlisted in [the final of Nanjing University-Huawei Cup Future Technology Competition](https://jw.nju.edu.cn/95/41/c26263a628033/page.htm). 

Previously, I also had a fantastic experience in the industry. I have worked as an engineering intern with Pixel Tips team in Google, Shanghai.
